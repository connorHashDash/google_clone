I created this project as part of learning web development via the Odin Project

Throughout this I learned about just how useful Flexboxes are (I can't imagine how things functioned
prior to it). 

I didn't want to get too precise with the placement, so most things might be slightly off by a few
pixels. I plan on coming back eventually and just nudging a few little things to make it perfecto.

I'm pretty new to all this so take a look and tell me what you think and give some suggestions!
